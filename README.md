## Description

Provide a short description explaining the what, why, and how of your project. Use the following questions as a guide:

- Enrolling in this class I was motivated to improve my development skills from largly self taught to having a deep knowledge to help boty my research and teaching pedadogy.
- This was built to get prepared for the forthcoming class and build a base knowledge of HTML, CSS, Git, and JavaScript
- I think the biggest thing I learned was propper protocol for using Git. I have experience in HTML, CSS, and JS so the refresher was nice but the functionality of Git was always lost on me.
